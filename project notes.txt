for that follow the steps:-

1.generate search component.
2.Give path in route.ts(path:'serach/:searchItem',comp:Homecomponent).
3.import activatedRoute & give instance.
4.through the instance we have to fetch the params & write the code reated to it.
5.In search.ts import activatedRoute.

When we click on image we should get the details of image in another page.
for that:-

1.generate food component.
2.give path in app-routing(path:'food/:id',comp:foodcompo)
3.create method in service.
4.import service in food.ts & give instance to it.
5.import activateroute & fetch params in food.ts.
6.work in food.html as we required.
 
when we click on tags we should get the items related to that tags.
for that:-

1.generate tags component.
2.give path in app-route(path:'tag/:tag',comp:homecomp).
3.create tags model.
4.create method in service & import tags model. 
5.import activatedroute in home.ts.
6.give condition in app.ts
